Maintainer: Darren Norris <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: Provides functions for demographic analysis of 
river turtle management options. Functions are organized in three groups, 
by name: "prep.." , "Pop..." and "res..." .
    "prep.." are functions used to generate spatial layers 
(poygons and raster files), with countries, catchments, rivers,
protected areas and human accessibility.
    "Pop..." are functions used for modelling population demographics.
    "res..." are functions used to generate results, 
producing tables and figures.
