# These large files are not available via github package.

# For the code below to work,

# This function needs 3 shapefiles as listed below.

# Subbasin cover polygons
B <- system.file("shape/amazon_orinoco.shp", package="cmartr")
# Extent polygon covering subbasins in species range of occurance.
# From prepBasin.R .
Bsp <- system.file("shape/speciesBasin.shp", package="cmartr")
# Human access from demog_river.R . Need to add earlier in prep stages.
BAc <- system.file("shape/basinsum4326.shp", package="cmartr")
# Human aceesibility raster
ras1 <- system.file("raster/uas.grd", package="cmartr")
# run
